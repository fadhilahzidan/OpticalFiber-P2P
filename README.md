# OpticalFiber-P2P
OpticalFiber-P2P is a Python-based simulation tool for point-to-point optical fiber communication systems.

## Features
1. Calculation of Optical Power Budget
2. Calculation of Bit Error Rate (BER)
3. Visualization of System Performance

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get started with OpticalFiber-P2P:
1. Clone the repository: 'git clone https://github.com/fadhilahzidan/OpticalFiber-P2P.git'
2. Navigate to the project directory: 'cd OpticalFiber-P2P'
3. Install the required dependencies: 'pip install [depedency]'
4. Run the simulation script: 'python calculate.py'

## Usage
1. Input the necessary parameters such as transmitter power, receiver sensitivity, fiber length, etc.
2. The tool will calculate the optical power budget and estimate the bit error rate.
3. The results will be displayed, showing the feasibility of the point-to-point optical communication system.

## Notes
- The OpticalFiber-P2P project was created to provide a simulation tool for analyzing point-to-point optical fiber communication systems.
